# Python - if/else, loops, functions

- Projects done during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/), a course offered by [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/).

## Technologies

- Files written in ```vi```, ```vim```, and ```emacs``` editors. 
- C files compiled using ```gcc 9.4.0```.
- C files wriiten according to the betty coding style. 
- Files tested on ```Ubuntu 20.04``` LTS using ```gcc```.
- ```Python3.4``` files 

## Files

|[1-last_digit.py](1-last_digit.py)|This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.py/blob/master/1-last_digit_py) in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.|
