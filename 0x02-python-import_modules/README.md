# Python - import & modules

- Projects done during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/), a course offered by [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/).

## Technologies

- Files written in ```vi```, ```vim```, and ```emacs``` editors. 
- Files tested on ```Ubuntu 20.04```.
- ```Python3.4``` files .

## Files

| Files  | Description/Question |
| ---  | --- |
|[0-add.py](0-add.py)|Write a program that imports the function ```def add(a, b):``` from the file ```add_0.py``` and prints the result of the addition ```1 + 2 = 3```|
|[1-calculation.py](1-calculation.py)|Write a program that imports functions from the file ```calculator_1.py```, does some Maths, and prints the result.|
|[2-args.py](2-args.py)|Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.|
|[3-infinite_add.py](3-infinite_add.py)|Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments: The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line. You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers). Your code should not be executed when imported.|
|[4-hidden_discovery.py](4-hidden_discovery.py)|Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).|
|[5-variable_load.py](5-variable_load.py)|Write ```a``` program that imports the variable a from the file ```variable_load_5.py``` and prints its value.|
|[100-my_calculator.py](100-my_calculator.py)|Write a program that imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations.|
|[101-easy_print.py](101-easy_print.py)|Write a program that prints ```#pythoniscool```, followed by a new line, in the standard output.|
|[102-magic_calculation.py](102-magic_calculation.py)|Write the Python function ```def magic_calculation(a, b)```.|
|[103-fast_alphabet.py](103-fast_alphabet.py)|Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase, followed by a new line. Your program should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use: any loops, any conditional statements, ```str.join()```, any string literal|
|[add_0.py](add_0.py)| A module prototype for ```add``` function.|
|[calculator_1.py](calculator_1.py)|A module prototype for ```calculation``` function.|
|[easy_print_101.py](easy_print_101.py)|A module prototype for ```easy_print``` function.|
|[fast_alphabet_103.py](fast_alphabet_103.py)|A module prototype for ```fast_alphabet``` function.|
|[variable_load_5.py](variable_load_5.py)|A module prototype for ```variable_load``` function.|
