## Files

| File   | Question |
|--------|------------|
|[0-rectangle.js](0-rectangle.js)| Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.|
|[1-rectangle.js](1-rectangle.js)| Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with a constructor with 2 arguments w = width and h = height.|
|[2-rectangle.js](2-rectangle.js)| Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with a constructor with 2 arguments w = width and h = height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.|
|[3-rectangle.js](3-rectangle.js)|Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with a constructor with 2 arguments w = width and h = height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X. |
|[4-rectangle.js](4-rectangle.js)| From [3-rectangle.js](3-rectangle.js), create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.|
|[5-square.js](5-square.js)| Write a class Square that defines a square and inherits from Rectangle of [4-rectangle.js](4-rectangle.js).|
|[6-square.js](6-square.js)|Modify [5-square.js](5-square.js).  Create an instance method called charPrint(c) that prints the rectangle using the character c If c is undefined, use the character X.|
|[7-occurrences.js](7-occurrences.js)| Write a function that returns the number of occurrences in a list.|
|[8-esrever.js](8-esrever.js)|Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list.|
|[9-logme.js](9-logme.js)|Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.|
