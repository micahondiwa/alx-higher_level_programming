- [100-github_commits.py](100-github_commits.py) - The Holberton School staff evaluates candidates applying for a back-end position with multiple technical challenges, like this one: ```Please list 10 commits (from the most recent to oldest) of the repository “rails” by the user “rails”
You must use the GitHub API, here is the documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/commits/
Print all commits by: `<sha>: <author name>` (one by line).` ``` 
Write a Python script that takes 2 arguments in order to solve this challenge
