## Files

| File   | Question |
|--------|------------|
|[0-rectangle.js](0-rectangle.js)| Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle.|
|[1-rectangle.js](1-rectangle.js)| Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with a constructor with 2 arguments w = width and h = height.|
|[2-rectangle.js](2-rectangle.js)| Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with a constructor with 2 arguments w = width and h = height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.|
|[3-rectangle.js](3-rectangle.js)|Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle with a constructor with 2 arguments w = width and h = height. If w or h is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object. Create an instance method called print() that prints the rectangle using the character X. |
|[4-rectangle.js](4-rectangle.js)| From [3-rectangle.js](3-rectangle.js), create an instance method called double() that multiples the width and the height of the rectangle by 2.|
