# Python-Object-relatiional mapping

- Projects done during my Full Stack Software Engineering studies at [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022/), a course offered by [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/).

## Technologies

- Files written in ```vi```, ```vim```, and ```emacs``` editors. 
- Files wriiten according to the betty coding style. Checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl).
- Files tested on ```Ubuntu 20.04``` LTS using ```gcc```.
- ```Python3.4``` files
